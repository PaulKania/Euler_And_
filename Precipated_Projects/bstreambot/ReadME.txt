Things I've done for the first time.

MSPAINT custom GRAPHICS GNARRRXXX
pickle - had tried before, didnt understand it as well as now.
	used well to impregnate and store state externally...pretty rad.
thats pretty much it :)

TO DO
Reddit post.
I made a bot.
for technical users: got more comfortable with pickling to save state out of the file.
other than that just wrestled with the tweepy api for a bit.
it follows the blockstream team's users.
then have twitter description point to reddit post.
it's probably worth it to own my own site, rather than use the github.io suffix

This Bot is dead simple.
It retweets the most active original content (no replies or retweets) from members of the blockstream team.
I also use it as a personal account (if you notice some activity that isn't inline with the above).



Things I've done for the first time.

pickle - To save state externally (specifically the state of the id's of the most recent tweets of each user I'm following.
MSPAINT custom GRAPHICS



TO DO
Reddit post.
I made a bot.
I beame more comfortable with pickling to save state out of the file.
other than that just wrestled with the tweepy api for a bit.
it follows the blockstream team's users, and automatically retweets their original content. No rewtweets, no replies.

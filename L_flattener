def flattener(ilist):
    o=[]
    for i in ilist:
        j= " ".join(i) #join replaces commas with " " j = i.replace(',',' ') DOES not work, i believe replace only works within a string, rather than between strings. #str.replace == str.split().join()
        # print(j)
        o.append(j)
    return o
